❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will lead to errors or unexpected behavior as the
function will try to access variables from the global scope (if they exist there) or result in `ReferenceError` if they
don't.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments. A sum function should ideally accept the numbers it needs to add as
arguments.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it clear that these are the values it expects to sum.
* ✔️ The variables `a` and `b` are now defined as parameters of the function, resolving the scope issue.
* ✔️ The function is now reusable and predictable, as it operates on the input arguments.

Additional notes:
Consider adding explicit type validation and error handling for cases where inputs might not be numbers. You could also
extend this to handle an arbitrary number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax.

Example with rest parameter:

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10
